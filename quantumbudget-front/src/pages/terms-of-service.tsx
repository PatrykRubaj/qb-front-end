          <p>
            From everyone at Quantum Budget, thank you for using our products!
            We build them to help you do your best work. Because we don't know
            every one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some
            Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we say “Company”, “I”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document,
            we are referring to Patryk Rubaj.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we say “Services”, we mean any product created and maintained
            by Patryk Rubaj (creator of quantumbduget.com). That includes
            Quantum Budget, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop
            application, mobile application, or another format.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people that own
            an account with one or more of our Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may update these Terms of Service in the future. Typically these
            changes have been to clarify some of these terms by linking to an
            expanded related policy.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to
            the latest Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and
            future products and all features that we add to our Services over
            time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any
            right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not
            waiving that right or provision. These terms do contain a limitation
            of our liability.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account.
            That's a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of
            trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open
            about who we are, how we work, and keeping an open door to your
            feedback.
          </p>

          <h2>Account Terms</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account
              and password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any
              loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security
              obligation. We recommend users set up two-factor authentication
              for added security.
            </li>
            <li>
              You are responsible for all content posted and activity that
              occurs under your account. That includes content posted by others
              who either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have
              their own logins under your account.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other
              automated methods are not permitted.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length
              of trial when you sign up. After the trial period, you need to pay
              in advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will
              freeze your account and it will be inaccessible until you make
              payment. If your account has been frozen for a while, we will
              queue it up for auto-cancellation. See our Cancellation policy for
              more details.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will
              charge your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the
              day of upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level,
              the new rate starts from the next billing cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
              All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by
              taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on
              behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing
              authorities. You are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies,
              or duties.
            </li>
            <li>We process refunds according to our Fair Refund policy.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account.
              Within each of our Services, we provide a simple
              no-questions-asked cancellation link. You can cancel your
              subscription by loging in, going to Profile -&gt; Billing portal
              and canceling your subscription there. An email or phone request
              to cancel your account is not automatically considered
              cancellation. If you need help cancelling your account, you can
              always contact our Support team.
            </li>
            <li>
              All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services
              immediately upon cancellation. Within 30 days, all content will be
              permanently deleted from active systems and logs. Within 60 days,
              all content will be permanently deleted from our backups. We
              cannot recover this information once it has been permanently
              deleted.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up
              month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you
              will not be charged again. We do not automatically prorate unused
              time in the last billing cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
              We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse
              any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason
              at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your
              account will not be able to access the account or any content in
              the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion
              of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture
              and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve
              the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any
              reason at any time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of
              abuse or retribution) of Company employee or officer will result
              in immediate account termination.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Modifications to the Service and Prices</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              We make a promise to our customers to support our Services until
              the end of the Internet. That means when it comes to security,
              privacy, and customer support, we will continue to maintain any
              legacy Services. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to
              continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because
              we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a
              product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or
              discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services
              with or without notice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When
              we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those
              changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing
              customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and
              will notify you via the email address on record.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Uptime, Security, and Privacy</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these
              Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer
              service-level agreements.
            </li>
            <li>
              We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your
              usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers
              of the Services. Of course, we'll reach out to the account owner
              before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of
              use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other
              customers.
            </li>
            <li>
              We take many measures to protect and secure your data through
              backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for
              data transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge
              cases where we may send your data through our network unencrypted.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take
              that trust to heart. You agree that Quantum Budget may process
              your data as described in our Privacy Policy and for no other
              purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following
              reasons:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To help you with support requests you make. We'll ask for
                express consent before accessing your account.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an
                automated process partway through. We get automated alerts when
                such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart
                automated processing without looking at any personal data, we
                do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of
                personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we aim to
                fix the root cause as much as possible to avoid the errors from
                reoccurring.
              </li>
              <li>
                To safeguard Quantum Budget. We'll look at logs and metadata as
                part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the
                Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts
                as part of an abuse report investigation.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the
              necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related
              technology required to run the Services.
            </li>
